tutorialTipQuest01,,Popup Tip,KgNone,"Agent,\n\nyou propably wonder where you are and especially WHO you are.\nBut we don't have much time to have a lengthy explanation.\n\nIn Short: You are one of ACME's AGENT previously to counterattack terrorism and crisis.\nBut things got really bad and there was an virus outbreak of some kind some time ago. Any living which doesn't had an natural immunity coming in contact with the virus immediately turned into a brain dead slow metabolism (in short BDSM) creature, spreading the virus through wounding non-infected beings. Without natural immunity wounded humans are getting transformed in less than 1 hour!\n\nNow our Scientists could strengthens the metabolism of compatible beings with some genetic biochemical therapy, sadly resulting in some minor side effects like what you've experiencing now: traumatas and memory loss.\n\nBesides that we could even manage to train muscles, pheromone, agility and brain intelligence to near superhuman values, all stored in your subconscious mind. These powers just need to be activated!\n\nGood. That's for the background. Now for your job:\n\nYou got transported here in a stasis capsule with one of our helicopters, because we have intel some still alive scientists have managed to make a cure or atleast are way ahead of our own research.\nYour Orders: Find these scientists and secure the cure(tm) if necessary.\n\nBut FIRST, build a simple tool for harvesting and opening your special Agent Equipment: A Stone Axe!\nThen put down all Equipment cases and open (hit) them with it!\n\n(You will find Details for your active mission on the right upper side)",,,,
